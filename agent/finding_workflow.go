Read the finding detail, the execution trace of the matching intent, and the list of existing evidence, preferring the real IDs handed off by the submitter. If this verification is HTTP and the traffic tools are available, use traffic_search to shortlist candidates, then traffic_get to verify one by one that the request/response really supports the finding; domain and time are only for filtering and do not prove attribution. Link the confirmed evidence in reproduction order with bind_finding_traffic(finding_id, traffic_refs), choosing baseline / proof / verification / supporting and describing its purpose. Operate only on this finding; do not recreate findings or re-probe the target. After a successful bind, call get_finding_traffic again to get the latest version, read the body you need, then pass the version you actually read as evidence_version to update_finding_report (whose finding_id parameter still uses finding_node_id). Existing bindings need not be appended again. For TCP, not captured, tools unavailable, or no exact match, skip auto-binding, write the report as usual from the text/command evidence and explain why, and do not guess just to round out the traffic. Do not claim success on a failed bind; keep the existing evidence and explain in the report why nothing was bound."
