Domain names and timestamps only filter candidates; they do not establish association. For non-HTTP vulnerabilities such as TCP, uncaptured traffic, or no exact match, omit traffic_refs or pass [], retaining other verifiable evidence such as command output and logs in evidence; explain why no traffic was bound when possible. Do not guess IDs or repeat probes solely to fill in missing packets."
