# Runtime image (does not compile inside the image): installs only common tools and drops in a **precompiled Linux single binary**.
# The binary is cross-compiled by the CI binaries job (pure Go, no QEMU) and placed per target
# architecture at dist/<TARGETARCH>/artex in the build context. This way, for multi-arch builds, arm64 only needs to emulate the apt layer,
# no longer emulating the Next/Go compile, which is much faster.
#
# When building the image manually on your machine, prepare the binary yourself first:
#   cd web && npm run build:static && cd ..
#   cp -r web/out server/webui/dist
#   CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=amd64 go build -tags embedui -o dist/amd64/artex ./cmd/artex
#   docker build -t artex:local .

# @playwright/mcp: the browser MCP runs directly as `npx @playwright/mcp` (already installed globally, no -y/@latest needed).
# @playwright/cli: provides playwright-cli; after install, --help verifies it is executable.
# Then install playwright (provides browser management); after install, --with-deps pre-provisions chromium and its system dependencies,
# so the MCP/CLI inside the container works on first launch without downloading a browser over the network.
