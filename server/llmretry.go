// Server-side resolution of the retry policy; see docs/llm-retry-design.md. Of the five layers:
//   - connect / empty response / same-provider safe window "follow the endpoint": each LLM
//     configuration can override the global default (a field left empty on a profile inherits
//     the global; when the global is unset too, the built-in default is used);
//   - circuit breaker / intent replay are process-wide, with only a single global copy.
//
// The global policy reads a single settings row from the DB once; its call sites are all on
// low-frequency paths (building a provider, work wrap-up, saving configuration), so another
// cache layer is not worth it. The breaker parameters are the exception — they are read on
// every pass of the failure path, so applyRetryPolicy pushes them to the Registry to hold.

// retryPolicy reads the global policy; a nil DB yields the zero policy (all
// layers on their built-in defaults).

// emptyTurnNudgeLimit resolves how many empty-turn continuations one work may
// inject (see steerHooks.Stop). It deliberately reuses layer ②'s knob — the "empty-response
// retry count": the two are two means to the same end. The SDK layer handles "not a single
// content block", and its means is to resend the same request as-is; here we handle "only
// thinking, with neither body nor tools", and the means is to append an instruction telling
// the model to continue from its existing thinking (resending as-is is meaningless for this
// kind of idling, which is determined by the shape of the context). The emptiness criteria
// differ because the SDK goes by "whether any event was ever yielded", while a thinking delta
// is itself an event — but when a user configures "how many times to retry an empty response"
// they mean "if the model produced no substantive content, try once more", so the two layers
// sharing a single count is what matches that mental model.
//
// It reads the global policy rather than a particular profile's override: a run may switch
// profiles mid-way due to failover, but this is the total-count gate for the whole intent and
// should not change along with the endpoint. The semantics are isomorphic to the SDK's
// emptyRetries(): 0 = the default defaultEmptyTurnNudges; -1 (negative) = disable empty-turn
// continuation; >0 = use that value.
